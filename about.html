          Bridging the Gap Between Design and Implementation
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          As web designers, we often struggle with the transition from mockups
          to real-world implementations. Even with powerful tools like Figma,
          the final coded result can often feel mismatched or lacking compared
          to our original vision.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Our UI component collection is designed to solve this exact problem.
          We offer a curated set of responsive, well-structured Tailwind CSS
          components that reflect real-world design practices.
